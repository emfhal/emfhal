ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Emmanuel (@emfhal on GitHub).

ðŸŒ± My technical interests are broad, but I have a particular affinity for Java, Python, Node.js, and PHP. I'm always looking to collaborate on projects involving these languages, so feel free to reach out if you have an interesting idea or need a hand with your project.

ðŸ’¡ I'm an expert at ideation and project building, with extensive knowledge in areas such as Language Model (LLM), Cloud Computing, Software as a Service (SaaS). I'm always looking to apply this expertise in new and challenging contexts.
