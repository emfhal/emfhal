ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Emmanuel (@emfhal on GitHub).

ðŸ”­ I'm deeply fascinated by the intersection of Technology and Finance, and I'm always eager to explore new advancements in these fields.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently expanding my knowledge and skills through an MSc in Computing Science. This journey is not only enhancing my understanding of complex computing concepts but also equipping me with the ability to apply this knowledge in practical scenarios.

ðŸŒ± My technical interests are broad, but I have a particular affinity for Java, Python, Node.js, and PHP. I'm always looking to collaborate on projects involving these languages, so feel free to reach out if you have an interesting idea or need a hand with your project.

ðŸ’¡ I'm an expert at ideation and project building, with extensive knowledge in areas such as Language Model (LLM), Cloud Computing, Software as a Service (SaaS). I'm always looking to apply this expertise in new and challenging contexts.
